I was involved in Interactivos? 2007 and Visualizar 2007 as a collaborator, and presented a project at AVLab 1.0, so with Interactivos? Laboral 2010 I have some idea of what to expect: an inspirational two weeks of intense project development, new friends and connections made, and some great work output.

I am especially interested in the Process-oriented subject matter of this year's call. I have been deeply influenced by cybernetics theory ever since I read Valentino Braitenburg's 'Vehicles' almost by accident some years ago. Ideas of process, feedback, and machine experience remain very important to the development of my work.

Damian Stewart is an artist, interaction designer, and creative programmer, originally from New Zealand and currently based in Vienna. His installation and performance work is driven by a desire to explore and communicate new kinds of experiences, and is based on a solid understanding of the history, material properties, and engineering qualities of the technological and digital systems he works with. Recent work includes projections, light performances, iPhone applications, custom electronics development, and environment sonification projects.

Damian has a diverse background that includes study in electroacoustic music, interior architecture, and computer science; professional software programming work on interactive museum installations and PlayStation2 games; and various music performances including free-jazz orchestras, solo electroacoustic improvised performances, and an electronica/dub band. He is a member of the New Interfaces for Performance (N.I.P.) collective, has performed internationally alongside artists including Biosphere and Deadbeat, collaborated on projects in UK, Netherlands, Austria, France, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, and New Zealand, and has been artist-in-residence with the Modulate collective in the UK and at the Home residency with André Gonçalves in Portugal.

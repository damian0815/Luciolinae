Damian Stewart is an artist working with light, sound, and technology, originally from New Zealand and currently based in Vienna. His installation and performance work explores and communicates new kinds of experiences, and is based on a solid understanding of the history, material properties, and aesthetic possibilities of the systems with which he works. Recent work includes installations, projections, light performances, iPhone applications, custom electronics development, and environment sonification projects. 

Damian has a diverse background that includes study in electroacoustic music, interior architecture, and computer science. He has been artist-in-residence in the UK and Portugal, and is shortly to begin a residency in Ljubljana.

Lucioliane transforms a blacked-out chamber into a liminal space. From small devices/creatures suspended at body height are emitted patterns of light and sound, which in fact encode patterns of behaviour communicated between devices. Each device tries to spread its own pattern by reproduction; in turn each device must also listen for external input to use as new patterns. Over time the patterns of this feedback system may stabilise, or they may become chaotic; all of this happens using light and sound, darkness and silence: media that can be interrupted or modified by the human body, bringing change even from observation. In Luciolinae, evolution, interaction, and experience all occur at the same time, in the same media, in the same space.
